## Project Overview
Imagine you're a data analyst at a multinational company like Google. Your task is to analyze the company's hiring process data and draw meaningful insights from it. The hiring process is a crucial function of any company, and understanding trends such as the number of rejections, interviews, job types, and vacancies can provide valuable insights for the hiring department.

As a data analyst, you'll be given a dataset containing records of previous hires. Your job is to analyze this data and answer certain questions that can help the company improve its hiring process.

Here's what you'll be doing:
- Handling Missing Data: Check if there are any missing values in the dataset. If there are, decide on the best strategy to handle them.
- Clubbing Columns: If there are columns with multiple categories that can be combined, do so to simplify your analysis.
- Outlier Detection: Check for outliers in the dataset that may skew your analysis.
- Removing Outliers: Decide on the best strategy to handle outliers. This could be removing them, replacing them, or leaving them as is, depending on the situation.

Data Summary: After cleaning and preparing your data, summarize your findings. This could involve calculating averages, medians, or other statistical measures. 
It could also involve creating visualizations to better understand the data.
Remember, the goal of this project is to use your knowledge of statistics and Excel to draw meaningful conclusions about the company's hiring process. 
Your insights could potentially help the company improve its hiring process and make better hiring decisions in the future.

- [Task-4](Task-4): Use a pie chart, bar graph, or any other suitable visualization to show the proportion of people working in different departments.
- [Task-5](Task-5): Use a chart or graph to represent the different position tiers within the company. This will help you understand the distribution of positions across different tiers.

## Recommendations - Results
- For calculating Gender distribution we need to use count function and then i taken pivot table for more visualization.
- By using dataset, i taken average function and calculate the average salary.
- Class interval is a range.For example, A manager told us to calculate how many employees are taking 20k-30k salary we use class interval and perform these operation.
- When we perform a Pie charts to suitable dataset
